# 🎬 Smart Anime/Episode Navigation System

## 🎯 Overview

Your MugiwaraFrostTV now has an intelligent navigation system that seamlessly handles both anime and episodes. Users can click on anime to view details and episode lists, or be automatically redirected to watch the first episode if only one exists.

## 🚀 How It Works

### **Smart Navigation Flow:**

1. **Click Anime** → Goes to `/anime/[id]` (anime details page)
2. **View Episodes** → Click any episode → Goes to `/watch/[episodeId]`
3. **Auto-Redirect** → If anime has only 1 episode → Automatically redirects to `/watch/[episodeId]`
4. **Watch Episode** → Click "More Info" → Returns to `/anime/[id]`

## 📁 File Structure

```
app/
├── anime/
│   └── [id]/page.tsx          # Anime details + episode list
├── watch/
│   └── [id]/page.tsx          # Episode player
└── api/
    ├── anime/
    │   └── [id]/route.ts      # Fetch anime with episodes
    └── episodes/
        └── [id]/route.ts      # Fetch specific episode
```

  return new Date(a.createdAt).getTime() - new Date(b.createdAt).getTime();
});
```
